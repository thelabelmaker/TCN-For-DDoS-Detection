To run the code first install tensorflow. I recomend using the docker install of tensorflow as this is what I did. I used tensorflow GPU with an RTX 2080. If you do not use docker, I recomend using a virtual envoronment so you do not change any other packages installed on your system.  In order to run the network files, you need to first download the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/devendra416/ddos-datasets/data. Only download the unbalanced dataset. Replace the file path in One_Hot_Encoding.py with the path to the dataset on your computer. Then install the requirements.txt file py running "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the python terminal. This will install all the required packages. Then run One_Hot_Encoding.py flowed by Create_Dataset.py. Then, the data for the networks will be created and the network can be trained by running the NO_IP_MODEL.py file which will train the network without the IP Columns, or the WITH_IP_MODEL.py file to create a network with the IP columns.
